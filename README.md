# Formula 1 SQL Data Analysis Portfolio

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to analyze Formula 1 race-level performance using a consolidated race-by-race dataset in order to evaluate:

- driver performance 
- constructor effectiveness 
- race dynamics 
- performance consistency over time

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from a publicly available Formula 1 database provided as a PostgreSQL SQL dump.
It contains predefined table structures as well as data inserts covering drivers, constructors, races, results, and related entities.

The dataset is already well-structured and normalized.  
The scope of this project focuses on SQL-based analytical exploration rather than data cleaning or ETL processes.

Only tables required for the analyses were retained and documented in the project schema.
