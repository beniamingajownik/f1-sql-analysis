# Formula 1 SQL Data Analysis Portfolio

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from a publicly available Formula 1 database provided as a PostgreSQL SQL dump.
It contains predefined table structures as well as data inserts covering drivers, constructors, races, results, and related entities.

The dataset is already well-structured and normalized.  
The scope of this project focuses on SQL-based analytical exploration rather than data cleaning or ETL processes.

Only tables required for the analyses were retained and documented in the project schema.
